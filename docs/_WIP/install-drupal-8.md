## Get ready

We assume you've already created a New App with fortrabbit. On your local machine you should have installed: [Git](/git), Composer, PHP, MySQL and Apache.


### Set the Apps root path

If you haven't already — in the Dashboard: [Set the root path](/app#toc-set-a-custom-root-path) of your App's domains to **web**.

<div markdown="1" data-user="known">
[Change the root path for App URL of App: **{{app-name}}**](https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com/apps/{{app-name}}/domains/{{app-name}}.frb.io/docroot)
</div>


## Install

You'll need a local Composer based [Drupal 8 installation](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project). Execute this in the following in your local terminal to initialize a new Drupal:

```bash
# Create a new Drupal project locally with Composer:
$ composer create-project drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev --stability dev --no-interaction {{app-name}}
```


### Local setup in the browser

<!-- TODO: link to local development setup help article, hint or link for now -->
Visit your local installation in the browser (localhost) and proceed with the installation wizard. 

### Configure fortrabbit environment

Create a new file `web/sites/default/settings_prod.php` with the following contents:

```php
// environment detection: Only triggered on fortrabbit
if (!isset($_SERVER['APP_SECRETS'])) {
    return;
}

$secrets = json_decode(file_get_contents($_SERVER['APP_SECRETS']), true);
$databases['default']['default'] = [
    'database'  => $secrets['MYSQL']['DATABASE'],
    'username'  => $secrets['MYSQL']['USER'],
    'password'  => $secrets['MYSQL']['PASSWORD'],
    'prefix'    => '',
    'host'      => $secrets['MYSQL']['HOST'],
    'port'      => $secrets['MYSQL']['PORT'],
    'namespace' => 'Drupal\\Core\\Database\\Driver\\mysql',
    'driver'    => 'mysql',
];
```

Now open up `web/sites/default/settings.php`. At the bottom of the file include the just created production file:

```php
// other code …
include __DIR__ . '/settings_prod.php';
```

### Configure deployment

Next, create the [deployment file](/deployment-file-v2) `fortrabbit.yml` in the top level folder of your Drupal project with the following contents:

```yaml
sustained:
    - vendor
    - web/core
    - web/modules/contrib
```

<!-- TODO: correct the following sentence (unclear, wrong english) -->
Make sure that the `web/core` folder, which contains the Drupal core itself, and the `web/modules/config` folder, which contains later installed modules.


#### Object Storage

fortrabbit Apps have an [ephemeral storage](/quirks#toc-ephemeral-storage). If you require a persistent storage, for user uploads or any other runtime data your App creates, you can use our [Object Storage Component](/object-storage). Once you have booked the Component in the Dashboard the credentials will become available via the [App secrets](/secrets).

Open up `web/sites/default/settings_prod.php` again and add at the bottom:

``` php
$schemes = [
    'object-storage' => [
        'driver' => 's3',
        'config' => [
            'key'      => $secrets['OBJECT_STORAGE']['KEY'],
            'secret'   => $secrets['OBJECT_STORAGE']['SECRET'],
            'region'   => $secrets['OBJECT_STORAGE']['REGION'],
            'bucket'   => $secrets['OBJECT_STORAGE']['BUCKET'],
            'options'  => [],
            'protocol' => 'https',
            'prefix'   => '',
            'cname'    => $secrets['OBJECT_STORAGE']['HOST'],
        ],
        'cache' => false,
    ],
];
$settings['flysystem'] = $schemes;
```

#### Flysystem

To use the Object Storage, you need file abstration. For this you install and enable the [Flysystem modules](https://www.drupal.org/project/flysystem) by executing this in the terminal:

```bash
# Install Flysystem
$ composer require drupal/flysystem dev-8.x-1.x
$ composer require drupal/flysystem_s3 dev-8.x-1.x

# Enable (drupal console must be called from the `web/` sub folder)
$ cd web
$ php ../vendor/bin/drupal module:install flysystem
$ php ../vendor/bin/drupal module:install flysystem_s3
```



#### MySQL

Now is a good time to export your local database and import it into your App. First you'll need to open up a tunnel to your App's MySQL database — [see here](/mysql#toc-mysql-via-terminal). Then you can execute this in the terminal:

```bash
# Fetch your fortrabbit database credentials
$ ssh {{ssh-user}}@deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com secrets MYSQL

# export local database
$ mysqldump -u<your-local-user> -p <your-local-db> > drupal.sql

# import into fortrabbit database
# you will be prompted for your fortrabbit database password
$ mysql -u{{app-name}} -h127.0.0.1 -P13306 -p {{app-name}} < drupal.sql
```

#### MySQL access from local

Please see the [MySQL article](mysql#toc-access-mysql-from-local) on other ways to access the database remotely from your computer.


### Configure Git

Create the `.gitignore` file, if it does not already exist, on top level:

```nohighlight
# Ignore directories generated by Composer
drush/contrib
vendor
web/core
web/modules/contrib
web/themes/contrib
web/profiles/contrib

# Ignore Drupal's file directory
web/sites/*/files

# Ignore local
web/sites/default/settings_flysystem.php

# Ignore files generated by PhpStorm
.idea
```

#### Initialize Git and deploy

Back in the terminal:

```bash
# Setup Git (if you haven't already)
$ git init .

# Add your App's Git remote repo
$ git remote add fortrabbit {{ssh-user}}@deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com:{{app-name}}.git

# Add all files
$ git add -A

# Commit files
$ git commit -m 'Initial'

# Push to deploy
$ git push -u fortrabbit master
```

Once the deployment has finished (takes much longer on the first time as all Composer packages need to be installed) you can visit the App URL in your browser:

* [https://{{app-name}}.frb.io](https://{{app-name}}.frb.io)
