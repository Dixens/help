On fortrabbit you won't find any old-school server admin control panel like CPanel. The fortrabbit dashboard is designed to give you fine-grained control over all of your Apps, manage collaboration and associated billing. It's pretty self-explaining. It's supposed to work in modern desktop browsers, including IE11.

## Dashboard scope

**Apps**: create, manage, scale and delete all of your Apps, get access credentials, set all kind of App-specific configurations, see metrics.

**Collaboration**: Manage your own teams and join other teams.

**Account**: Manage your SSH access keys, password, e-mail preferences and everything else associated.

**Billing**: Manage your different Companies and Billing Contacts, see invoices.


## Accessing the Dashboard

You will need your e-mail address and your Account password to login.  
[dashboard.fortrabbit.com](https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com)

## Regaining access

**Forgot your fortrabbit Dashboard password?** No problem, send yourself a recovery mail to your Account e-mail address.

**Lost your 2FA device?** Hopefully also not a big problem. Use one of the recovery codes we gave you upfront.
