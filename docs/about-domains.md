Each fortrabbit [App](/app) has its own, unique [App URL](/app#toc-app-url). Additionally you can route any external domain to your App. Your goal here is to have your App running under your own domain.

First off, make sure that the App knows about the domain. Then point the domain to your fortrabbit App with your domain provider. Start the process in the fortrabbit Dashboard like so: 

1. Click: Your App > Domains > "Add a new domain" button
2. Choose: a domain name
3. Set: the [root path](/app#toc-set-a-custom-root-path)
4. Use: the provided informations to route the domain with your domain provider


## Advanced routing options

The world of DNS is one of its own. Let's dive into it – understand the backgrounds, explore advanced and alternative settings.


### www and other subdomains

Back in the days the www. prefix indicated that this is an address to type into the browser. Nowadays the www. prefix indicates a "cloud-enabled" application which can be moved in seconds to another server location. Test it: all big players run on a www. subdomain. The name of the subdomain prefix is not so important, but `www` is the convention for (marketing) entry points. We also use `help.fortrabbit.com` for the page you are currently reading and `blog.fortrabbit.com` to publish our thinkings.

The trick is that you can route subdomains using `CNAME` records. With this you tell your DNS provider to send resolve to a more variable `hostname` instead of a fixed `IP`. The great advantage is that the IP address behind the hostname target can change later on — without your intervention.

### Naked domains

There are so called "naked"-, "APEX"- or "root"- domains. They have no prefix and look like so: `fortrabbit.com`. On a on a aesthetic level, they are more pleasing than there subdomain counterparts. But they don't play well as primary domains with cloud services like ours. Naked domains can't be routed with `CNAME`, they require an `A`-Record type rooting. 

You could grab the IP of your App and use that as an A-record for your domain. It's technical possible, but than your App will be offline, once we move it to a another Node (as the IP changes).

You could just use CNAME routing for your naked domain. It's theoretically possible, but not recommended by [DNS specs](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt) and also would break any e-mail delivery for your domain.

You still should care about your naked domain, as some users might type it in directly in the browser. So you want to forward all requests from your naked domain to your primary canonical subdomain:


#### Forwarding a naked domain to www

When you enter a `www.` domain with fortrabbit, we additionally provide you with a forwarding service for your naked domain. You'll get two routing values, the main CNAME routing which targets to your App URL and an additional A-record that points to our forwarding service.

```plain
HOSTNAME      TYPE       VALUE
-------------------------------------------------
@             A          0.0.0.0 < See Dashboard for actual IP
www           CNAME      your-chosen-name.frb.io.
```

That will redirect all requests for the naked domain to the www version. 



#### Alternative ways to use a naked domain

You don't have to use our free domain forwarding service, here are some alternative options:

##### ALIAS / ANAME routing

In the fortrabbit Dashboard you can add a naked domain. To make this work you need a domain provider that supports so called "ALIAS" or "ANAME" routing. This allows you to have the functionality of CNAME routing (host-name instead of IP) on a naked domain. These domain / DNS providers offer support:

* [DNSimple: ALIAS records](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/alias-record/)
* [DNS made easy: ANAME records](http://help.dnsmadeeasy.com/managed-dns/records/aname-records/)
* [Easy DNS: ANAME records](https://fusion.easydns.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/190/7/aname-records/)


##### Forwarding using your domain provider

Some domain providers also support a simple HTTP redirect. Please see your domain providers documentation. Here are some examples:

* [GoDaddy: domain forwarding](https://support.godaddy.com/help/article/422/manually-forwarding-or-masking-your-domain-name)
* [Gandi: domain forwarding](https://wiki.gandi.net/en/domains/management/domain-as-website/forwarding)
* [1&1: domain forwarding](http://help.1and1.com/domains-c36931/manage-domains-c79822/domain-destination-c38672redirectforward-your-domain-a594868.html)


### Using CloudFlare

Please see our [CloudFlare article](/cloudlfare) on how to setup and use CloudFlare together with fortrabbit.

## Troubleshooting DNS

You can use the Terminal (Bash) to see the current DNS settings of your domain. With the `dig` command you can see if there are any CNAME entries and where they are pointing to. Here we lookup `help.fortrabbit.com` and see a CNAME pointing to the App URL: `help-frbit.frb.io`.

```
$ dig ANY help.fortrabbit.com
;; Truncated, retrying in TCP mode.

; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> ANY help.fortrabbit.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 44565
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 3, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;help.fortrabbit.com.       IN  ANY

;; ANSWER SECTION:
help.fortrabbit.com.      600    IN  CNAME   help-frbit.frb.io.
help-frbit.frb.io.        300    IN  CNAME   help-frbit.eu2.frbit.net.
help-frbit.eu2.frbit.net.  20    IN  A       52.48.51.144

;; Query time: 863 msec

```

Alternately you can use a browser based DNS lookup tool. See [these results](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=dns+lookup).

## Time delays

Most DNS records have a TTL (Time To Live) of 24 hours. This means that all name servers will only look every 24 hours if a domain target has been changed. In some cases it might even take longer. That is actually a good thing as it helps to reduce round trips. Some providers let you set down the TTL, this can be useful when moving domains.





## Testing domain routing with your local hosts file

Let's say you have your domain registered with your fortrabbit App and are now ready to point the domain to fortrabbit. Before changing your domain's name-servers, you want to test it. Or you have pointed the domain to fortrabbit but it doesn't really show up yet, so you want to know where the error is.

To test the routing on the fortrabbit side: Tell your local computer to visit a certain IP for a certain domain without looking for official DNS entries. To do so, add your Apps IP address as an entry on your computer's hosts file.

### hosts file location

The hosts file is a text file (without file type ending). It can be found here:

* Windows: `c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`
* MacOS & Linux: `/etc/hosts`

### How to get your Apps IP

See the above troubleshooting section to grab the current IP of your App. Mind that this IP might change in the future and that this IP is just for now.

### Editing your local hosts file

Your local file contains many entries, do not edit those. Just add a new line with the IP of your App and the domain you want to see routed there like so:

```
# pattern (how it works)
[your App's IP address] [your fully qualified domain name]

# example (how it looks like)
12.0.0.1 mydomain.com www.mydomain.com
```


### Undo changes to your hosts file

After your domain has been moved/propagated be sure to remove the entry from your hosts file.



## Choosing a domain provider

fortrabbit is not offering direct domain registration and management. In classical hosting, domain registration & e-mail hosting where bundled in packages. Today you can find specialized domain services. There are various offerings, so you should consider upfront what you'll need:

1. Additional IMAP/POP3 e-mail hosting
2. Additional SSL certificate ordering
3. Specialized in advanced DNS configurations
4. Exotic TLD-endings
5. Support for forwards with ALIAS or ANAME records — see [below](#toc-forwarding-a-naked-domain) 

Many of our clients are using classical offerings combining domain ordering and e-mail hosting. Others are using separated services for domain registration and e-mail hosting.


### Configuring your domain for e-mail

So far we have covered how to route a domain to fortrabbit. To receive and send e-mails from your domain you will configure the MX record of your domain. Please see your e-mail hosting provider for instructions.
