Each fortrabbit [App](/app) has its own, unique [App URL](/app#toc-app-url). Additionally you can route any external top-level-domain to your App. Your goal is to have your App running under your own domain. This is the high level of what's gonna happen:

<!-- TODO: rewrite on launch of www-izer domain handling  -->

1. register `www.mydomain.com` with the App in the fortrabbit Dashboard
2. route `www.mydomain.com` via CNAME to `your-app.frb.io` using your domain provider
3. forward all requests for the naked domain `mydomain.com` to `www.mydomain.com` with your domain provider or even a third party service

And here are the details:


## Choosing a domain provider

fortrabbit is not offering direct domain registration and management. In classical hosting domain registration & e-mail hosting locked-in the user. Today you can find specialized domain services. There are various offerings, so you should consider upfront what you'll need:

* Additional IMAP/POP3 e-mail hosting
* Additional SSL certificate ordering
* Advanced DNS configurations
* Exotic TLD-endings
* Support for forwards with ALIAS or ANAME records — see [below](#toc-forwarding-a-naked-domain) 




## Route a custom domain

Many different and advanced configurations are possible, see below. Here is the dead simple setup:

#### 1. Domain provider

Point `www.yourproject.com` using `CNAME` to your fortrabbit App URL `my-app.frb.io` (use your own App URL here).

```plain
HOSTNAME      TYPE       VALUE
-------------------------------------------------
www           CNAME      your-chosen-name.frb.io.
```



#### 2. fortrabbit Dashboard

Enter the domain `www.yourproject.com` as a new external custom domain in the domain settings of the App in the [Dashboard](/dashboard). 

Additionally you might set a [custom root path](/app#toc-set-a-custom-root-path) and [change the default domain](/app#toc-change-the-default-domain).

Please also see our [TLS help article](/tls) to learn about options for https encryption.


## Advanced routing alternatives

The world of DNS is one of its own. Let's dive into it. Understand the backgrounds, explore advanced and alternative settings.


### www and other non-naked subdomains

Back in the days the www. prefix indicated that this is an address to type into the browser. Nowadays the www. prefix indicates a "cloud-enabled" application which can be moved in seconds to another server location. Test it: all big players run on a www. subdomain. The name of the subdomain prefix is not so important, but `www` is the convention for (marketing) entry points. We use `help.fortrabbit.com` for the page you are currently reading and `blog.fortrabbit.com` to publish our thinkings.

The trick is that you can route subdomains using `CNAME` records. With this you tell your DNS provider to send resolve to a `hostname` instead of an `IP`. The great advantage is that the IP address behind the hostname target can change later on — without your intervention.

#### CNAME for naked domains

It is theoretically possible to create a CNAME record for a naked domain. **Just don't do it.** It's not allowed because [the DNS specification says so](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt).

The problem is that `CNAME` records do not behave like the other records (`A`, `MX`, `TXT`, …). They are *greedy*. This means: They *overwrite* all other records.

An example: assume you have a domain `domain.tld` and want to receive mails for it. So you create an `MX` record. Say it points to `mail.domain.tld`. If you now would create a `CNAME` record directly for `domain.tld` pointing to `otherdomain.tld`, every lookup of any record for `domain.tld` will be made on `otherdomain.tld` instead (aside from the `CNAME` record itself).


#### Forwarding a naked domain

Ok, let's say that you have your primary domain routed via CNAME to the www domain. Now what should happen when users enter the address without www prefix in the browser? It should redirect to the www version automatically. And here is how to that:

In **fortrabbit Dashboard** you should add the naked domain `yourproject.com` as well as primary domain `www.yourproject.com`.

At your **external domain provider**: forward naked domain `yourproject.com` to subdomain `www.yourproject.com` using ALIAS or ANAME method.

Some domain providers also support a simple HTTP redirect. This basically means: they provide a web server for you and redirect all incoming requests to `http://domain.tld/` to `http://www.domain.tld/`. Alternative names for this feature are "Domain forwarding", "Web forwarding", "Domain masking" and the like.

**Domain forwarding docs of some domain providers**

* [GoDaddy domain forwarding documentation](https://support.godaddy.com/help/article/422/manually-forwarding-or-masking-your-domain-name)
* [Gandi domain forwarding documentation](https://wiki.gandi.net/en/domains/management/domain-as-website/forwarding)
* [1&1 domain forwarding documentation](http://help.1and1.com/domains-c36931/manage-domains-c79822/domain-destination-c38672redirectforward-your-domain-a594868.html)

When your external domain service does not support such forwarding methods, you can make use of a free service like [RootDirect](https://www.rootredirect.com/) or [wwwizer](http://wwwizer.com/) for naked domain redirects. It's pretty simple, as they do not even require any registration or setup, you only need to point your naked domain to their IP and they will redirect to your `www.` address. 



### Time delays

Most DNS records have a TTL (Time To Live) of 24 hours. This means that all name servers will only look every 24 hours if a domain target has been changed. In some cases it might even take longer. That is actually a good thing as it helps to reduce round trips. Some providers let you set down the TTL, this can be useful when moving domains.

## Troubleshooting domains

You can use the Terminal (Bash) to see the current DNS settings of your domain. With the `dig` command you can see if there are any CNAME entries and where they are pointing to. Here we lookup `help.fortrabbit.com` and see a CNAME pointing to the App URL: `help-frbit.frb.io`.

```
$ dig ANY help.fortrabbit.com
;; Truncated, retrying in TCP mode.

; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> ANY help.fortrabbit.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:

Alternately you can use a browser based DNS lookup tool. See [these results](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=dns+lookup).




## Testing domain routing with your local hosts file

Let's say you have your domain registered with your fortrabbit App and are now ready to point the domain to fortrabbit. Before changing your domain's name-servers, you want to test it. Or you have pointed the domain to fortrabbit but it doesn't really show up yet, so you want to know where the error is.

To test the routing on the fortrabbit side: Tell your local computer to visit a certain IP for a certain domain without looking for official DNS entries. To do so, add your Apps IP address as an entry on your computer's hosts file.

### hosts file location

The hosts file is a text file (without file type ending). It can be found here:

* Windows: `c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`
* MacOS: `/etc/hosts`
* Linux:  `/etc/hosts`

### How to get your Apps IP

See the above troubleshooting section to grab the current IP of your App. Mind that this IP might change in the future and that this IP is just for now.

### Editing your local hosts file

Your local file contains many entries, do not edit those. Just add a new line with the IP of your App and the domain you want to see routed there like so:

```
# pattern (how it works)
[your App's IP address] [your fully qualified domain name]

#example (how it looks like)
12.0.0.1 mydomain.com www.mydomain.com
```


### Undo changes to your hosts file

After your domain has been moved/propagated be sure to remove the entry from your hosts file.
