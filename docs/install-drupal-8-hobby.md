## Get ready

We assume you've already created a New App with fortrabbit. You should also have a [PHP development environment](/local-development) running on your local machine.


### Set the Apps root path

If you haven't already (the stack chooser does that for you) â€” in the Dashboard: [Set the root path](/app#toc-set-a-custom-root-path) of your App's domains to **web**.

<div markdown="1" data-user="known">
[Change the root path for App URL of App: **{{app-name}}**](https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com/apps/{{app-name}}/domains/{{app-name}}.frb.io/docroot)
</div>
