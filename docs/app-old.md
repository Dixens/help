We have three generations of Apps/Stacks here on fortrabbit: 

* **Old Apps Stack** (2013 - ~2017?) this here
* [Professional Stack](app-pro) (from 2015 on) < formaly known as New App
* [Universal Stack](app-uni) (from 2016 on)

Please be warned that the Old Apps are currently phasing out. We recommend not create any new Old App any more. Old Apps are in sun set phase. 


## Migrating

Unfortunatly, we can not switch the App for you. Apps have to be migrated manually. You can choose how you would like to migrate your Old App:

1. **[Migrate Old App to Universal Stack](/migrating-old-to-universal)** < most commonly used
2. [Migrate Old App to Professional Stack](/migrating-old-to-professional)
