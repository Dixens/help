Each [App](/app) with fortrabbit already comes with a Git repo. See our [Git guide](/git) for details. So why would you want to use [GitHub](/github) or [Bitbucket](/bitbucket) or alike together with fortrabbit at all? Well, Git with fortrabbit is mostly used as a deployment tool. fortrabbit does not offer the familiar enhanced collaboration tools, such as "pull requests", because we concentrate on doing one thing well: deployment. You might be quite used to that, or it is a requirement in your company. Whatever the case: don't panic. Using Github or Bitbucket alongside with fortrabbit is no hassle at all.
