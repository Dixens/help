## Free trial

There is no [free web hosting](http://blog.fortrabbit.com/free-web-hosting) and that's ok. But you can test fortrabbit before you pay a dime. All you need to do is: sign up to fortrabbit and try it for free.  Of course: You don't need to opt-out, but you can, of course, opt-in.

## Pay after usage

No upfront costs nor payment! **First you book a component, then you'll use it, then we'll invoice you** for what you have actually used.

## Cancel anything at any time

You can always quit. Scale down or kill certain Apps or even cancel your Account completely.

## Monthly invoices

Within the first days of every new month you will get the invoice for your last month's consumption. You can also download all your previous invoices in the Dashboard.

## Daily billing cycle

When you book a Component on the 16th day of a month and the month has 30 days you only pay for the 15 days you're using the product. The minimum billing period is one day. For paid support this rule does not apply! Support plans are billed in full calendar month increments.

## Plans & prices

The service structure is modular. Most Components come in different size and flavors, you can combine anything as needed. Please see our **[pricing page](https://www.fortrabbit.com/pricing)** for an up-to-date pricing & product table.

## Storage & traffic limits

Each App includes a fair amount of web storage and traffic. These are soft limits, small exceeding and peaks will be tolerated. See our [specs page](https://www.fortrabbit.com/specs) for over-traffic costs.

## Costs monitoring

Log in to the Dashboard > Billing Contact. There you'll find a cost preview for the ongoing month, covering all of your Apps.

## Payment methods

You can pay by **credit card** (Visa & Master, no debit cards) or **SEPA direct debit** (EU clients only). For "enterprise clients" we also offer to pay by **bill** (on account).


## Billing mail address

You can setup a different e-mail address for each Billing Contact.

## Taxes

fortrabbit is a B2B hosting solution, it's for entrepreneurs only, we expect you to use it professionally. While that can mean anything and nothing it has some fiscal implications:

* Our prices are shown as net prices without Value Added Tax (VAT).
* If you are a non-VAT registered company in a EU country, we add VAT.
* If you are a VAT-registered company in a EU country and add your valid VAT IN, we don't charge you VAT.
* If you are a VAT-registered company in Germany, we add VAT, but you will get it back from your tax-office.
* If you are a company from a NON-EU country, we don't charge you VAT.

### VAT-IN from clients in EU countries

We recommend to enter your VAT-IN with your Billing Contact. This way you save upfront costs for VAT — reverse charge makes this possible.

## Why am I still charged for this?

We get a few e-mails each month after invoicing. People are confused why they still see Apps on the invoice that have been deleted.

Usually you pay upfront for stuff you book online. You want something, you pay for it. Due to the above described fair pricing, upfront payments are not possible with fortrabbit.

fortrabbit has a consumption based billing. The minimum billing period is one day. That means we charge after usage. Just like with your old telephone bill. At the end of the month you'll get an invoice for what you have used in that month.

So, when you start using an App on the 15th of Jan, you'll be invoiced at the end of Jan for using the App for half a month.

So at the start of each month you'll get an invoice for the stuff you have booked last month. Also look at the invoice period.


## What if I cancel my Account?

We will delete all your Account data. But it is required by law to keep your billing related data, that is basically the invoices and infos around it. The same applies to your credit card informations, but those are stored with our credit card service merchant — not with us. 

And yes, if you cancel the service while still having open invoices with us, they stay open and we might take further legal steps to finally get that money.


## What if my credit card has not enough credits?

Then it will bounce — which costs us a lot of money each month. We might pass those costs to the clients in the future. We will inform you about bounced payments. We also try to debit again.


## What if my credit card expires?

We will inform you. Please add your new credit card details to your Billing Contact.


## What if I have open invoices with fortrabbit?

Please just pay your open invoices, you can do this in the Dashboard (Login & follow the instructions). If you are unable to pay them immediately, please least contact us. Otherwise we might delete your Apps. See [this story](https://blog.fortrabbit.com/bounced-payment).
