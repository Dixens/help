## Get ready

Let's have a quick check-up before we get started here:

1. You have already [signed up to fortrabbit](https//dashboard.fortrabbit.com/signup)
2. You should have created a plain vanilla [App](app) (free trial)
3. You should have a [PHP development environment](/local-development) or at least [Git](/git) running on your local machine



## Deploying

The following code gets executed on your local machine in your terminal application. The lines starting with a `$` are the ones you execute. The following code examples include the Git clone URL from your App: **{{app-name}}**.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo — Initialize Git by cloning the empty repo from fortrabbit
$ git clone {{ssh-user}}@deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com:{{app-name}}.git
# Cloning into '{{app-name}}'...
# warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository

# 2. Change directory to your new local project
$ cd {{app-name}}

# 3. Create an index php file with a bold messsage on the fly
$ echo '<?php echo "PHPower to the PHPeople";' > index.php

# 4. Add the change in the working directory to the staging area
$ git add index.php

# 5. Commit the staged snapshot to the project history
$ git commit -am 'initial commit'

# 6. Just push to deploy
$ git push -u origin master
# Counting objects: 3, done.
# Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 251 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
# Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
